In This Project,I have used Python Libraries like Pandas,numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn to derive some useful information from The Movie Industry Dataset.I found the following things-
* Votes and Budgets are highly Correlated with the Movie's Gross Revenue ie.,Higher the Votes and The Budget,Higher is The Movie's Gross Revenue.
* Warner Bros is the company with the highest Gross Revenue
* Companies having PG-13 Rating have made the most Gross Revenue
