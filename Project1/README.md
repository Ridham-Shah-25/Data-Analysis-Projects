I wrote Custom SQL Queries to analyze the Covid-19 Deaths and Vaccinations Dataset available publically.
I discovered the following things-
1. I found out the countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to populationm.Cyprus,San Marino and Faeroe Islands have the highest infection rate.<br>
2. I found out that United States,Brazil and India were the 3 Countries with the highest Total Death Count.<br>
3. I found out that China,India and United States were the 3 countries with the highest No. of Total Vaccinations.<br>

I used concepts like Joins,CTEs,Temp. Tables and Views in the SQL Queries executed
